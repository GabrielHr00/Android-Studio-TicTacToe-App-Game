# Android-Studio-TicTacToe-App-Game
The App serves as an exercise. It should be a Tic Tac Toe game, which consists  of 3x3 or 9 fields, where the first player places a X and the second O. When someone makes a pont, it will be showed there on the top. Also when i want to reset the game, when for example the players are other people, just press the button Reset and the points of the 2 Players will be set at 0. Also when i rotate the view/screen the game and the view will be the same as in normal screen.
